Welcome to the Article Generator documentation.

Article Generator is a tool that creates article stubs for blog posts written
in Pelican.  Yes, Article Generator is a terrible name.

Use case:

I want to write a new blog post for my Pelican based web-site.  In the past,
I've kept a blank article saved on my hard drive.  When I write a new article,
I take the blank template, change the metadata, write the article and then do
a "File: Save As" to save the new article.  That's not too tough, but being
a bonehead, I often overwrite my blank article with the new filled in article,
or I save it to the wrong folder, or I get the date wrong, you get the idea.

So, to help with that, I've come up with Article Generator.  It generates
your empty article templates for you and takes care of some of the minor
housekeeping.

I'm afraid, I'll be getting more out of Article Generator than anyone
that may stumble upon it and use it.  Here's all the learning that's in it
for me:

- Write a complete application (Python)
- Build the user interface (PySimpleGUI)
- Write the accompanying documentation (Sphinx)
- Build tests to go with the application (Pytest)
- Release it as open source (Github)
- Gain an understanding of the entire work flow
