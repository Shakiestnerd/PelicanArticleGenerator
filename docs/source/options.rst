When you generate a blog article using the tool, many of your selections are saved
to an *articles.ini* file.  The next time you run the Article Generator application
this file will be read and those values filled into the form for you.

The thinking is that your next article may reuse many of the same options.  So,
the tool tries to help you out with that.
